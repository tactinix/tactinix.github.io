Hi, I'm tactinix. 

This is my personal space for notes, opinions and other writings, mostly on
Linux, BSD's and Vulnhub boxes.

A long term Linux and Opensource user and advocate, think Slackware 3.6
running on a Pentium MMX here. 


My wife says I make the best roasted red-pepper hummus, but I'm more of
a steak kinda guy.


Have the best day ever!
