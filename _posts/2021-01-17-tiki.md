This box centers around a remote authentication bypass in Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware 21.1.

## Enumeration

Starting of with nmap -

```
nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap ip-adress
```

## Services running on the box
On port 80 is the default Ubuntu Apache "It works" page.

The robots.txt file points to the /tiki installation

Looking at that presents the tiki deafalt page

Trying the usual admin:admin fails;

 So onwards to Google, which points to the exploit listed on exploitdb found at https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48927 reported in August 2020.

Before running the exploit, let's take a look at the smb share on the box with smbmap.

On the ```Notes``` share we can find credentials for the ```silky``` user;

But before the found credentials are put into use, let have a look at the exploit.

As the output suggested, login with ```admin``` and no password. In Zap, which is my preferred tool, this can easily be done by initiating a login in the proxied Firefox session, setting breakpoints in Zap and editing the input as desired.

Stepping through the breakpoints, we hit the admin page.

Browsing the interface, a page listing credentials are found;

## Capture the flag
As the box is also running Openssh, might be worth a try;

Whaddayaknow, the user ```silky``` is in the ```sudo``` group.

Have a great day!
